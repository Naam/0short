0short let you either shorten and/or encrypt and url you want to share.
For exemple let say that you want to share a direct link of a deep web
resources on a non trusted network then only send the public part of the
URL and separately send the key on a trusted one. Or you may simply want
to shorten a long and ugly link.

The crypto system is based on a AES256-CBC cipher with a random key
by stretched with PBKDF2.
